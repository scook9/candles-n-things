## Future Updates

As this application develops, we hope to add functionality with Stripe for customers to be able to create and purchase their own orders directly from the website. Additionally, we hope to develop a user profile login to be able to curate product recommendations for each individual user, perhaps saving a history of previous purchases to refer to; and tp add reviews to product pages, describing their own experiences with these products.
