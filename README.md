## Description

This is a full stack ecommerce site for Star Ray design, a botique shop wich sells candles, soaps and salt scrubs.

## Installation Instructions

Since the app is deployed to heroku, simply open the deployed webpage. For dev purposes, clone the github repo to your local device, then run "npm init" and "npm i". Next copy the contents of the schema.sql into your mysql editor or manually in the command line to create the database. Once the database has been created run "npm run seeds" to seed it, and "npm start" to kick off the server on your local host.

## Usage Information

When in the app, use the links in the navigation bar to access the homepage, cart, and shop page. When in the shop page you can use the buttons at the top to change the displayed items based on category or view all. Afer clicking add to cart, your desired items will be added to the cart. We do not yet have functionality to place an order.
